#  C. shasta Spore and Hydrology Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project is a complete data pipeline developed in **R** to analyze the relationship between ***Ceratonova shasta*** spore concentrations (a pathogen affecting fish) and environmental factors—specifically **river discharge** and **water temperature**—in the Deschutes River system.

The pipeline automates the cleaning, standardization, merging, and plotting of both biological (spore) and environmental (gauge) datasets to identify potential hydrological or thermal drivers of spore concentration.

##  Project Structure

The analysis is broken down into a series of sequentially dependent R scripts ($\mathbf{01}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbf{04}$) and organized output directories.

| Folder/File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| data | Contains all raw and clean data subdirectories. |
| plots | Contains all output figures from the four scripts, organized by sub-folder. |
| R | Contains the four sequential R scripts that make up the analysis pipeline. |
| **README.md** | **This overall project summary file.** |
| README_01_WATERGAUGE.md | Documentation for the environmental data cleaning script. |
| README_02_SPORES.md | Documentation for the spore data cleaning script. |
| README_03_OVERLAY_ANALYSIS.md | Documentation for the core comparative analysis script. |
| README_04_CUSTOM_SITE_PLOTS.md | Documentation for the custom high-resolution plotting script. |

##  The Analysis Pipeline

The R scripts **must be run in sequential order** ($\mathbf{01 \rightarrow 04}$) as each script depends on the clean data files generated by the previous steps.

| Script | Goal | Key Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01_watergauge...R** | Clean and standardize gauge data (Discharge/Temp). | Converts discharge to **$\mathbf{\text{m}^3/\text{s}}$ (cms)** and assigns water_year. |
| **02_spore...R** | Clean and process spore data (OS/PT). | Calculates **daily mean spore concentration** per site. |
| **03_spore_overlay...R** | Core comparative analysis and general plotting. | Executes a **many-to-many join** to match spore data to both gauge sites for every date. |
| **04_custom_site...R** | Specialized, high-resolution plotting and EDA. | Generates **single-WY hydrographs** (with 7-day mean) and **log-transformation validation plots** (boxplots/histograms). |

##  Required R Packages

All scripts require the installation of the following R packages:

* `readr`
* `dplyr`
* `lubridate`
* `janitor`
* `ggplot2`
* `scales`
* `patchwork`
* `here`
* `zoo`
* `rlang`

## VSCode Extensions for R Development

* **R Extension for VS Code:** Provides core language features (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, R terminal interaction).
    * `REditorSupport.r`
* **R Debugger:** Essential for setting breakpoints and debugging R scripts.
    * `REditorSupport.r-debugger`
